Version: 1.0-0
Authors@R: "Colin Millar <colinpmillar@gmail.com> [aut,cre]"
Description: Contains all functions required to (1) Read in temperature logger calibration data
  (External and Internal) (2) calculate approximate calibration functions to convert
  raw temps to true and raw temps to SE of approx (3) output a file containing calibration
  results by logger for use as a bulk upload to FLEObs database.
