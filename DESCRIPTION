Description: Contains all functions required to (1) Read in temperature
  logger calibration data (External and Internal) (2) calculate
  approximate calibration functions to convert raw temps to true and
  raw temps to SE of approx (3) output a file containing calibration
  results by logger for use as a bulk upload to FLEObs database.
